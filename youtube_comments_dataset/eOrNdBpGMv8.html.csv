Now, I watch the infinity war trailer and am like ""Thinking logically of the event that happened in the (marvel movie) post credits scene, we can assume that(important detail/character) may affect the plot of Infinity War because of the evidence in Infinity War's trailer. More evidence of this is because in (specific marvel comic) Something along the lines of this happened.""﻿"

ham,10 years later a new trailer for marvel will bring me back here to appreciate all the years you guys entertained the world.﻿
ham,What a shit trailer and shit movie. Marvel is The Netflix of production.﻿
ham,"Usually trailers are way better than the movie. In this case, the trailer doesn't even begin to reveal how great a movie this was. I just started watching superhero movies in early 2016. Because I hated the 1980's Batman movies so much, I gave up on the superhero genre entirely, and never watched another until 2016. X-Men movies won me back (on DVD). Then, I got into the MCU (again, on DVD). Now, I can't get enough. This original Avengers is my favorite in the MCU, with ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" a close second. I've rewatched each of these more than five times, and they are still fantastic and wonderfully rewatchable. In the DCEU, Wonder Woman is my favorite of any superhero movie ever, but I hated Batman v Superman so much I wished I hadn't seen it. Justice League was good enough to enjoy, but not anything close to this phenomenal Avengers movie, each having a six-become-one theme.﻿"
ham,Memories﻿

ham,who came back to watch this trailer cause of the infinity war trailer? 🙋﻿
ham,"Seriously hard to believe this is already six years old. I remember before this, Marvel was kinda on the DC side with occasional good movies. Now they are kicking ass against DC and always have something good to throw at us, even if it's not the best, it still manages to be really damn good. Who woulda thought Disney buying Marvel would've led to so much greatness. Kinda makes you wonder where we'd be now if that didn't happen.﻿"
ham,Came a long way﻿
ham,2017 near the end of the year.. still watching this trailer﻿
ham,That moment when you realize Infinity war is coming out exactly six years after the first avengers movie.﻿

ham,It's been a long journey... (sniff)﻿
ham,"I really think that Iron Man, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Guardians of the Galaxy - Volume.2 are MCU's best works yet. They actually had both the quality and the quantity within themselves. The rest are either decent or nothing more but a comedic-visual spectacle fest with no real substance to their plots.﻿"
ham,How the hell did infinity war get more views than this in 16 hours?!!? This trailer has been up for 6 years lol﻿
ham,I am here after watching the Infinity War trailer to experience again the first feel of that massive scale of perfection they brought up in all these years....loved it and gonna love it forever...i really wish Tony to survive but it's almost the apocalypse time now so be ready to handle anything just like Game of Thrones style.﻿
ham,Destiny always arises﻿
ham,OH MY GOD THEY USED THE SAME LINE FOR IW﻿
ham,Anyone from 2017...?﻿
ham,Why did this pop up on my recommended? The nostalgia from 6 years ago. I remember when this trailer was new and seeing the cleverly edited shot of Tony being thrown out of the window and Steve falling on the car﻿
ham,There was an idea..﻿
ham,2017 Dec nd watched trailer for the first time 😂﻿
ham,"This one trailer is better than the entire Justice League movie, no lie﻿"
ham,Only six years? Feels like twelve.﻿

ham,"Can't wait till this movie comes out, I've been saying for it﻿"
ham,this trailer is sooooo bad﻿
ham,Who Came Here After Watching The Avengers 4 Official Trailer?﻿
ham,Wow its come so far﻿
ham,"4th of May 2018





Movie theatres are about to get raped hard by Marvel fans!﻿"
ham,Lets make this trailer trending too guys.....﻿
ham,This is where it all began... Now we are up in space !!﻿
ham,"0:41 It's crazy how much this one little sentence means to all of this, even today. The way they used it in the Infinity War trailer was especially clever.﻿"
ham,İt looks old now﻿
ham,the way that they made trailers like 5 years ago. memories!﻿

ham,Who else keep watching trailer even though they already saw movie﻿
ham,So the Infinity War trailer is out. Hit me with speculations and predictions.﻿
ham,Who's here after watching the avenger infinity war trailer﻿
ham,This trailer is so dated already 😂﻿
ham,It's shocking how bad the sound track was﻿
ham,This is one of the best superhero movies no doubt and in 2012 this trailer was awesome but now it seems like a old old trailer in the style.. It's very subpar compared to today's comic trailers.. All of them DC trailers are really good but there movies are not at all in this day in age.. Now if the DCEU movies came out in the 2000s they would be legendary but when u put em next to the great one we get every year they are very below standard.. Most ppl enjoyed fantastic 4 back in the 2000s due to there being not much to compare it too.. This new Justice league back in 2007 would have been adored by all!!﻿
ham,Trailers have certainly gotten better since then﻿
ham,"Dc: don’t worry soon there will be bvs

Marvel:Ok Infinity war time boys﻿"
ham,2017﻿
ham,I remember watching in this in theaters as a kid like when I was 11 and the part where hulk slammed Loki in the stark tower made me laugh so hard everyone laughed at my laugh LOL.﻿

But now looking back I can see for what it was and it is garbage. None of characters are interesting or likeable, they took WORST parts from classic Avengers and modern Ultimates and made this. 
Sadly, in history it will go as one of best MCU movies, if not one of superhero movies in general, and vise versa for First Avenger. Just another reminder that I share this very planet with an absolute plebeians.﻿"

ham,"There is one thing thats been bugging me and i thought i'd ask it here, the avengers are in the marvel universe which is the same one the x-men are in, now in Avengers age of Ultron they refer to Vibranium/steel alloy that Captain America's shield is made of is the strongest metal on Earth which would make it stronger than Adamantium, meanwhile in x-men origin's they refer to Adamantium as the strongest metal on Earth so if the strongest metal is in fact Vibranium then why not just say Wolverine's bones are coated in the second strongest metal? and why say to Wolverine his claws could cut thrue anything as it would clearly not be able to cut thrue Captain America's shield in actuality he would be at a disadvantage against Captain America.﻿"
