ham,Anyone realized that Katy perry switched her outfit real quickly and got to the spot to sign all in one motion﻿
ham,Timberlake was better jajaja﻿
ham,"Nice performance, but Katy Perry's voice was ugly﻿"
ham,this is how you do it﻿

I just came to know about this sufi saint who lived in the Indian subcontinent (Kashmir Valley) around 900 years ago. He has made a lot of predictions about the indian subcontinent and the world in general leading up to the final armageddon in the form of Persian verses and, surprisingly, those predictions are coming true with the passage of time. The most surprising thing is that he has actually mentioned the names of personalities and places several times.

The large Jewish presence in Palestine which has not been seen in two thousand years. Hal Lindsey says in The Late Great Planet Earth that before the establishment of the State of Israel none of the future events were clearly understood, but now that that has occurred, the countdown has begun for the occurrence of the indicator events connected to all of the types of prophecy, and on the basis of the prophecies, the entire world will focus on the middle-east, and especially Israel in the last days. 

They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity. Ezekiel 7:19

Therefore I say unto you (Jews), The Kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, The Kingdom of God shall be taken away from you (Jews),  (HOLY BIBLE) Matthew 21: 45 

Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? . neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, (lCo 6:9) Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. (l Co 6: 10) 

Therefore I say unto you (Jews), The Kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, The Kingdom of God shall be taken away from you (Jews),  (HOLY BIBLE) Matthew 21: 45 

Surely Lord God knows all that is (spoken) aloud and what is hidden.
""As I live,"" says the Lord God, ""surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you.
I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered,
with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out. And I will bring you into a wilderness of the peoples, 
and there I will plead My case with you face to face. Just as I pleaded My case with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will plead My case with you."" (20:33-36)

 Ezekiel.22. prophesied the Zionist Gathering of Jews, and that it will lead to a major disaster to Zionists: ""the house of Israel has become dross to me; therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst, and you shall know that I, the Lord, have poured out my fury upon you. 

(al-Isra')
4  And We conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Scripture: You will commit evil on earth twice, and you will rise to a great height.
5  When the first of the two promises came true, We sent against you servants of Ours, possessing great might, and they ransacked your homes. It was a promise fulfilled.
6  Then We gave you back your turn against them, and supplied you with wealth and children, and made you more numerous.
7  If you work righteousness, you work righteousness for yourselves; and if you commit evil, you do so against yourselves. Then, when the second promise comes true, they will make your faces filled with sorrow, and enter the Temple as they entered it the first time, and utterly destroy all that falls into their power.
8  Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you. But if you revert, We will revert. We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.

(Announcement)

""The National Football League welcomes you to the Pepsi Super Bowl 49 Halftime Show""

KATY : Super Bowl are you ready to rock ? ""

(Applause)

COME ON!

""Roar""

I used to bite my tongue
And hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat
And make a mess
So I sat quietly
Agreed politely


I guess that i forgot
I had a choice
I let you push me past
The breaking point

I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything

You held me down
But I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound (Hey!)
Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

CHORUS

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar (roar louder)
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna…
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (hey!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!

""Dark Horse""

I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I’m capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don’t make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

CHORUS

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for (you should know)
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse (like a dark horse)


Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine (oh yeah!)
There’s no going back
There’s no going back
There’s no going back

""Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Lenny Kravitz""

""I Kissed A Girl""

(Lenny Kravitz)

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion

(Katy Perry)

It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

(Lenny Kravitz and Katy Perry)

CHORUS

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it

(Katy Perry)

I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

""Teenage Dream""

You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine

CHORUS

You make me
Feel like
I'm living a, teenage, dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops
When you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe
This, is, real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight, tonight

KATY: (Make some noise Super Bowl)

(crowd applause)

""California Gurls""

I know a place ( sing it!)

CROWD: (where the grass is really greener)

Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek
Oh, oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh,oh

CHORUS

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

(MISSY ELLIOT)

""Get Ur Freak On""

Missy be puttin' it down, I'm the hottest 'round
I told y'all, y'all can't stop me now
Listen to me now, I'm lastin' twenty rounds
And if you want me then come on, get me now
Is you with me now? Then biggie, biggie bounce
I know you dig the way I sw-sw-switch my style
Holla
People sing around
Now people gather 'round, now people jump around

[Hook]
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on
Go, getcha getcha getcha getcha getcha freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on

""Work Around""
Is it worth it? Let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup (lets go Super Bowl)

If you got a big *elephant trumpet*, let me search ya
And find out how hard I gotta work ya
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup

""Lose Control"" (solo)

(Music make you lose control)
I got a cute face, chubby waist
Thick legs, in shape
Rump shakin, both ways
Make you do a double take

Planet rocker, show stopper
Flow proper, head knocker
Beat scholar, tail dropper
Do my thang

(Just throw your hands in the air!)
(Just throw your hands in the air!)
(Just throw your hands in the air!)

Music make you lose control

""Fireworks""

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

PRE CHORUS

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

CHORUS

'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

CHORUS

'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

OUTRO

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Oh yeah yeah

Thank you and God Bless America!

ham,"Wow,,﻿"
ham,Dat hot ass tho for California Girls﻿
ham,Her first performance that good is﻿
ham,"I’m actually very sad to see y’all pitting katy against gaga. Listen.

Gaga
- definitely better vocals
-included a family like theme, and included a very important message in the beginning, that according to her intended to bring all together
-didn’t have too much distractions ( not saying katy’s was very distracting 🤦🏻‍♂️) and it felt as if she was not trying to make hers the best with any elaborate sets. Didn’t feel forced
-no guests, as she had too many hits to perform 😂 
-flying on the stage, iconic

Katy
- definitely more extravagant
- included a surprise guest
- costumes and sets were great 
- special effects were better, because of that stage
-flying, also iconic
-encore was good

Both legends!﻿"
ham,Katy  Perry la mejor del mundo mundial jjjjj Sigue Adelante te queremos😁😁😁😁﻿

ham,Taste the cheery chopstick fucking best ever Katy ❤️❤️ rock the hell out keep being you﻿
ham,Why did Lady GaGa do the show by herself?﻿
ham,My favorite super bowl﻿
ham,"She's not a dancer nor is she following a hard steps routine and she's not singing this is a pre recored track. Please, tell me how she is ""the best entertainer"" ""the best super bowl of all time"" Britney Spears pre super bowl show was 903403490 times better than this take away all the dancers and special effects from the show it would be so boring﻿"
ham,pretty good but not that much entertaining﻿
ham,Quality of this re-broadcast is very good. As the years go on and Super Bowl halftime performances stack up I can still say this is the best Super Bowl Halftime show ever.﻿
ham,"I Love her!!!!! I am not here for the childish individuals that are in a war of comparing, you make me sick and you need a diaper. I base each performance on  their own merits. She delivered!!!!!﻿"
ham,Aww poor left shark😂😂﻿
ham,How they do that lion thing﻿

ham,10:05 I love how they just used one of those WiiMote straps :D﻿
ham,The best Super Bowl halftime show ever﻿
ham,"I don’t know why people keep comparing Gaga with Katy. Gaga did not rely on visuals, or guest appearances to fill up time on a 13 min show. Gaga delivered incredible vocal range all while dancing, busting all the same moves her dancers were doing. No gimmicks, no distractions from what a super bowl halftime should be: display of raw talent.﻿"
ham,4:38 lol the guy behind katy and the fake water is just smiling 😂😂😂﻿

ham,"Para mi él mejor medio tiempo hasta hoy. Cante o no cante dió un espectáculo increíble. Dirán que fue muy infantil pero hay que ver a que público iba dirigido que son los adolescentes.

ham,Jolie﻿
ham,im here after lady gaga.﻿
ham,She's So perfect!!!!﻿
ham,"Gaga's and Perry's shows couldn't be more different. Gaga was the center of her show through and through, with her amazing pipes and slick dancing being the highlights of the entire thing. Also shown was her prowess at the piano, the slight political undertones that showed unity at at time when we needed that message most. Perry's was an all out assault on the senses in the best possible way, and a technical marvel at that. The colors,  the lightening, the effects, even the feel-good pop sensibility of Perry's music was built to be nothing more than the best crowd pleasing show you could ever ask for.  Perry and Gaga were in full command of their audiences, and played well to their respective strengths as artists. Why does this need to be a competition between the two? There's plenty of room here for both artists to excel and be fantastic. Both women have their pros and cons, and I think they balance each other out well. Why can't we love both?﻿"
ham,"My top 3 halftime shows:
1. Katy Perry
2. Lady Gaga
3. Michael Jackson﻿"
ham,Goosebumps﻿
ham,I really wonder what happened to katy now .....﻿

ham,HOLA﻿
ham,Wow....she can sing!﻿
ham,I like songs of Katy and missy﻿
ham,cati like love you﻿
ham,Katythequeen💚💚💚﻿
ham,"This is my honest opinion: she needed two guest artist to seem good. Her dancing is lacking, her general vocals are lacking. And her facial expression.. you can tell by it that she is not a nice person, which is backed up by how she shades other artists. I tried to appreciate this performance, but could't. Just screaming 'baby youre a firework', is not singing in my opinion. I can't get myself to like her.﻿"
ham,lol the tilted stage reference﻿
ham,Still the best!﻿
ham,Katy Perry﻿
ham,better than the superbowl﻿

ham,"A mi me encantan las dos lady gaga y katy pero a mi la vdd me gustó más katy en super bowl, lady no estuvo mal pero siento que le faltó invertirle más a la escenografía con sus canciones era para más mucho más!﻿"
ham,"I am so impressed! Excellent appearance, singing, dancing, acting. She writes and composes her songs also, I think. 
So universally artistic woman. 
But also demonstrate special abilities like: Superfast, almost magical dressing up. Singing while flying. On this tiny platform, I probably would not be capable of controlling my sphincters even. 
I wonder how she do in bed. Men should want her. Women should envy her. 
Respect to Katy!﻿"

ham,wonderful song!﻿
ham,O melhor de todos da Super Bowl. Katy Perry dá o nome.﻿
ham,Katy performance was better than Gaga﻿
ham,"This isn't hate butttttttttt.........all i can say is Katy is super talented and unnaturally pretty HOWEVER...I don't know what it is with this new era of performing...its now more about theatrics than the actual artist wowwing us with their talent. I mean, I see performances like this at Olympic ceremonies. Im not saying its bad its just...I've seen it before. I'd say the dancers and lights and graphics/cameras are out-performing her. Maybe I""m just a stand-and-sing kind of person but it wouldve been awesome if she rocked out with a guitar, sang some anthems somewhere in between, or put on a stage show--not an olympic ceremony in the middle of the circus. When Missy came out it just got kinda awkward. Again this wasn't bad and I DO like Katy but this was just a little hmmm....﻿"
ham,Beyonce super bowl was way better than this amateur performer.﻿
ham,One of the best performances of Katy Perry! <3﻿
ham,eso es mucha cosota﻿
ham,Only in America !﻿
ham,Lady Gaga FTW!!!﻿
ham,❤🐙🐒﻿
ham,"I'm an obsessed little monster, Gaga is my life, and I believe this was the best superbowl halftime show of ALL time. I was never interested in Katy besides her hits, until Witness. I've always felt that she was a bit fake. But now that she left that Katy character a bit aside, I can really see her true self. This performance proves she really IS capable of being an outstanding artist.﻿"
ham,Trump for President!﻿

ham,The Firework's perfomance is the best that i've ever seen.﻿
ham,WOW🙉🙉🙊🙊﻿
ham,"Holy shiz when Katy performed firework, it was so epic!!﻿"
ham,Best Halftime Show EVER﻿
ham,la mejor <3 <3 <3﻿
ham,"Jajajaja, el show lo hizo Missy Elliot.﻿"

ham,😍😍😍😍😍😍﻿
ham,she really killed this﻿
ham,katy Perry la mejor 2017 👌👌👌﻿
ham,I like the tiger one﻿
ham,Katy was great but Missy was amazing﻿
ham,There is a reason why Katy's is the most watched superbowl. She brought America Fireworks! She let us shine even tho we are in the dark﻿
ham,"Still the best halftime show Katy was singing her #1 hits while gaga sang her sucking flop songs.
#nohate #peace﻿"
ham,"I'm a little monster and honestly this is entertaining and cute, but Katy really doesn't change everything is so catchy and childish in a way it's for children. (no hate) but Gaga is better way more matured and shows true performance I also like this show tho.﻿"
ham,me encantó😍﻿
ham,What has happen to her. I think she is starting to loose it. I think she is having a identity crisis.﻿
ham,Maravilhosa 😍😃﻿
ham,lev mit tigri katy﻿
ham,katy really shined like a firework on her song firework...my most fav song of katy 😍😍😍﻿
ham,Last half decent super bowl half time show Coldplay sucked then this years was even worse.﻿
ham,I LIKE TEENAGE DREAM THE SHARK PART IS ONE OF HER BEST SONGS. LIKE IF YOU AGREE KATY PERRY IS THE BEST.😘😘﻿
ham,Charlizzeeee💜💜﻿
ham,that fucking tiger of the beggining maybe cost more than my house and it was made for be used just for 2 minutes!!﻿
ham,"I think the best part of ""Firework""﻿"
ham,5:36﻿
ham,notice how one of the shark's forgot the dance moves﻿
ham,Lady Gaga is best!﻿
ham,The last part SUPERB GOOSEBUMPS﻿
ham,el mejor super bowl de la historia y de mi vida i love katy perry﻿
ham,"siempre dije que no habría nadie en él mundo que superara a Madonna y su puesta es escena. viendo esto, katy podría ser la única, es más, creo q la supero. mis reinas del pop. shapó katy﻿"
ham,shook﻿
ham,"me encanta este video ,ucho﻿"
ham,she does have a powerful voice 😍﻿
ham,J lo mismo﻿
ham,"Holy crap! That audience involvement was amazing!!! Everyone was singing so clearly and loudly in unison. In terms of singing abilities, Gaga wins but I actually like Katy's performance better. That is not to say that Gaga's wasn't amazing in its own right but rather I just thought Katy's was more to my liking.﻿"
ham,So roar I love this live show!!!❤️🌷🎈🎉✌️😃﻿
ham,"This is definitely the best super bowl in terms of presentation, staging, costumes etc. But Katy herself isn't a very engaging performer to be honest, she has an incredible creative team behind her. People remember the sharks more than her actual performance.﻿"
ham,Firework was my favorite﻿
ham,katy parrys performance is nothing compared to lady gagas performance now 😱😱😱﻿
ham,This was (in my opinion OKAY!)  probably the worst half time show in recent years.﻿
ham,não me canso de assistir...Katy e espetacular ...uma energia que contagia ...﻿
ham,who is that singer with her ??????????????﻿
ham,sHE SELLS SEX CAUSE SHE CAN'T SING PATHETIC﻿
ham,she can't sing how is it that I am not in this industry will need to look into Autotune again  pathetic she can't sing live and gets millions  wow she lip syncing THE ENTIRE THING﻿
ham,"oh my gosh she is not even singing this live!?  1:02 see the ""up"" which she doesn't even sing pathetic shes a fraud and a fake!﻿"
ham,BEST SUPERBOWL PERFORMANCE EVERRRRR﻿
ham,Dude the Dark Horse number was fucking incredible. One of the most visually appealing performances I've ever seen.﻿
ham,Lady Gaga did much better﻿
ham,Thank God For Missy Elliot 👌🏽🔥﻿

ham,y⛪﻿
ham,"I have the biggest love and respect for Lenny and I definitely think he rocked the shit out of this perfomance. But how come his guitar haven't been plugged?  I didn't notice any cords. Please someone explain, cause I don't want to belive he didn't play live :(﻿"
ham,"I am a devoted Katy Cat and I am an equally devoted Little Monster..I love adore Gaga n Katy both but if I have to be honest then I have to say Katy was slightly better than Gaga. First of all,Katy performed only her hits whereas Gaga included the ""Million Reasons"" disaster only to promote it. Nextly, Gaga's dress was not bad but it was not at her own level. She is much more stylish than that dress. Moreover Katy was much more imaginative. So being unbiased, Katy wins﻿"
ham,"Freaking cool showtime, Katy killed it big time.﻿"
ham,Thats the guy from the movie hungergames Cinna﻿

ham,for the next SB halftime i want to see daenerys and drogon hahaahh﻿
ham,Dark Horse is such a Illuminati themed song it's insane. That checkerboard floor thing confirmed it once again ;)﻿
ham,She's a bad artist. They think using stage props hides the fact that she can't dance and she's a bad lipsyncer. Poor tink tink.﻿
ham,Katy Perry  é um lixo.﻿
ham,Overall this was good but wow she fucked up Teenage Dream; that song is way to high for her; Lenny Kravitz was incredible ﻿
ham,like katy perry﻿
ham,melhor super bowl. perfomace.💗💗 KATY perry﻿
ham,who's here after watching bon appetit﻿
ham,"I love ❤️ Katy but its was lipsync, Gaga was 1000 time better with NO LIPSYNC AT ALL from the beginning to end﻿"

ham,nice﻿
ham,katty fat than i thing about her﻿
ham,"every single time I see this performance I just think of what a genius mind she has to have created and had such great creative ideas, ppl can say she's not a great singer but the reason she's so successful is because she's creative and puts detail into her performances I never get tired of watching this﻿"
ham,"Michael Jackson, U2 and Lady Gaga, The Best Ever.﻿"

ham,Best Super bowl ever?﻿
ham,What a playback omg﻿
ham,Katy is a Queen!﻿
ham,media voz <3﻿
ham,some part or mostly are lip sync.﻿
ham,This is iconic.﻿
ham,"I actually think she did a good job. The point of a super bowl Is to put on a show for a good 10-12 min. And she did that. It was very entertaining to watch. Not as talented as Gaga, Madonna, Beyoncé or anyone else but she's Katy. Not them. Stop comparing and enjoy the performance factor. I'm not a huge Katy fan but I think she did very well. I was actually more entertained watching this than Gagas but I do like Gaga.﻿"
ham,Please take me back when was the super bowl of Michael Jackson. (However this one was so enjoyable)﻿
ham,"Nah Beyonce still being the best Super Bowl, but the tiger was so cool﻿"
ham,Lady Gaga is best performer﻿
ham,KATY IS SO AMAZING!﻿
ham,"lol what a pish !
gimme a normal live band any day.
and fuck off w/that voice echo/enhanced/HIDE  shit .﻿"
ham,"Now we know both she and Gaga can rock the superbowl and sing live. I'm waiting for a collab between the two, because that would probably be a mega super hit.﻿"

ham,PUTA QUE PARIU QUE FODA﻿
ham,beyonce and katy perry took superbowl to a whole new level with the visual effects......1:50 to 3:00...its just freaking awesome...﻿

ham,boring﻿
ham,"the best super bowl is in Lady Gaga :* 
but this is not bad .﻿"
ham,I'm a Little Monster and KatyCat but sorry GaGa's show was the best..Katy's show so colorful and funny but she's not good at live singing﻿
ham,cuál es la canción del minuto 9:10?﻿
ham,What happened to the original with more views﻿
ham,"Not a Katy Perry fan but the ""I kissed a girl"" part with Lenny Kravitz was pure magic.﻿"
ham,I'm reading through all this comments saying Gaga was way better. Ok so no one is better u may think they are of you r a fan but keep that to yourself my opinion was all the performances where amazing and no one was better﻿
ham,7:16 As always the niggas are fucking everything !!!﻿
ham,"Okay why is everyone comparing her to Lady Gaga for? This was in 2015 for godsake! Grow up all of you! Katy's good, Gaga's good, END OF DISCUSSION!﻿"
ham,who is the man in 3.00﻿

ham,La mejor Katy 😍😍😍﻿
ham,a shame for white puritans americans﻿
ham,when you drink too much of redbull﻿
ham,This is such an enchanting performance﻿
ham,well in short it's bigger and better than any performance no doubt gaga performance was really great but you need to be more that a strong vocalist to make it happen and Katty simply nailed it﻿
ham,Amazing...Wow :-)﻿
ham,I just came back from watching Micheal Jackson on the Super Bowl and let's just say there's no comparison whatsoever.﻿

ham,i thought this was the best superbowl performance XD i got goosebumps during the firework song﻿
ham,song 7:20﻿
ham,"Children do your research. Type Katy Perry CERN, Beyonce CERN or Gaga CERN into youtube and discover what you are really seeing. Typing CERN after almost any entertainment including movies, television, etc... and you will see all the shared symbolism. Then you just need to ask why pop stars and actors are exposing these images to you.

Cheers﻿"
ham,Like Katy perry California gurls﻿
ham,Michael Jackson's Super Bowl performance was way better and got the loudest crowd pop﻿
ham,Imagine if REAL football had this at half time. In the FA cup when Stoke are beating Arsenal 1-0 and this bird rolls out on a tiger at Wembley 😂😂﻿

ham,احلا بنت وأحلا  اغنيه﻿
ham,OMFG  Katy out did herself with the Super Bowl....You go girl...﻿
ham,"I think this is the most entertaining half time show ever. It is not about the vocal anymore it is about how you give entertainment. Vocal is boring with out like this. Katy i salute you for not being a good singer but a hope to others that singing is nothing without talent like you, you gave me smile while watching you :)﻿"

well I'm so happy cinna to see you alive and singing..﻿"
ham,One of the best in terms of costumes and gimmicks. I wish Katy couldve done more like dance although I know shes not a dancer. The performance with Lenny Kravitz was one of the best collabs in Superbowl I think.﻿

ham,em firework sempre me arrepio﻿
ham,I'm sorry Missy Elliot stole the show lol﻿
ham,"Did not anyone here realize that Katy Perry used playback on all songs and did not sing a song with her own voice? She was in the whole presentation was using playback and for those who want evidence, look 10:05. And for those who said that Katy's was better than Gaga's, know how to identify that of Gaga herself who was singing with her own voice. THANK YOU﻿"

ham,"muy bueno el performance de Katy, cumplio con las expectativas de un superbowl, claro que los comentarios están llenos de Little Monsters inseguros que vienen a tratar de convencer al mundo y a sí mísmos que el de Gaga fue ""mejor"", pero seamos sinceros, la de Gaga parecía mas bien un acto básico de su Artpop ball y la ""mejor parte"" (cuando se lanza del techo) fue pre-gravado, nada trascendental el de Gaguis, esperaba a Billboard haciendo un listado de los mejores superbowl poniendo a Gaga en una posición alta (como generalmente suele hacer), pero ni Billboard se atrevió a hacer eso :/﻿"
ham,why are they even hold those microphones to their mouths?﻿

ham,"Alguien mas quiere que ariana grande este en el 2018 
Pd: Soy arianator por eso ja﻿"
ham,One of the best halftime Super Bowl ever﻿
ham,"I'm a Katycat and I would say I love Gaga's performance and she is a better singer with her vocal prowess. BUT, I am much in love with Katy's performance because there are ALWAYS good visuals that are so entertaining to watch. Each live performance has its own uniqueness although it's the same song. Some may say it's the tech people creating the big visuals, but no. Katy literally plans herself and she plans everything even camera angles! She knows she's a ""control freak"" as mentioned in her Superbowl's BTS. It's outstanding how much effort, which we don't get to really see, Katy puts in the planning process to channel her creative artistry, instead of normally singing & dancing her way through the medley. And of course we know Katy can't dance like Gaga, which I think is one of the reasons why Katy loves visuals to keep the audience hyped not only to the audience around her but to ALL people in the stadium.

So yeah, although I enjoy Gaga's, to me Katy's one is better overall. Of course, opinions vary as what you're looking for in an artist may not be the same as what I'm looking for.﻿"
ham,katy perry shouldve won many grammy﻿

Everything was perfect! (I mean! the only down part was probably the long minutes given to Missy, I think the first song and work it is enough.But maybe the minutes was needed to start Fireworks.

ham,"why am i only seeing now Katy as an iconic diva! Ghaaaa she is great!!!!
I love Gaga but i think I would still prefer this one..
This will be the next best halftime performance next to Michael. Performance wise,everyone would pick Bey,coz she dances so great.
But Katy's visuals are on-point!Not to mention that some of her songs (esp Roar and Fireworks) is very apt for this kind of event! SOngs that should be heard by many!
Exactly why I'm picking her next to MJ-because they both have the most inspirational songs,sang here in superbowl halftime show.﻿"

ham,"its true , Katy is the champion﻿"
ham,"And this is better than the Lady Gaga show ?, please !, unless you're a puberty with less than 15. Gaga, no doubt is one of the most complete artists of our generation, she sing, dance, did acrobatics, Entrance iconica, undoubtedly one of the best along with that of Michael Jackson. Katy could do better, but her voice was pre-recorded, except in the part of Firework she sing super horrible.﻿"

ham,진짜 지린다﻿
ham,"Sure Katy Perry's adorable. But honestly Gaga's way better. Lady Gaga was so energetic and did some acrobatics and crazy dance moves on her performance. Katy on the other hand, needs so much workout on her dance. She looks cuter when she can sway more her hips. But totally, both of them are good, only Gaga performs better.﻿"
ham,💖💖💖﻿
ham,no le salio las voz bien﻿
ham,"Este es el super bowl que más me ha gustado, es increible los diferentes vestuarios que usa. Bruno y Beyonce fueron lo mejor del Super Bolw 50, Lady Gaga pienso que pudo haber hecho más. ﻿"

ham,Katy ♥♥♥♥♥﻿
ham,She was doing playback so bad﻿
ham,Who is that rapper?﻿
ham,"10:07 this is the main difference between Gaga and Perry.... Gaga made flips, splits, piruettes in the air while singing live on point and holding the microphone... Perry was standing akwardly with the microphone wrapped in her hand... You know why right? cause if this motherfucker microphone dropped it will end her career by revealing that she was lipsyncing.....﻿"
ham,"hahahah I don't know but I am seeing some comments here saying Katy is better than Gaga
I'm sorry but how can you compare a legend like Gaga with a lip-syncer like Katy?????﻿"

ham,2017 ?﻿
ham,katy and gaga <3﻿
ham,Lenny is cool﻿
ham,"Katy Perry's was the best between hers and gaga's.
Katy sang perfectly live and not pre-recorded it at all. Also more entertaining, beautiful visuals and sound was clear and loud. While gaga's voice was mostly awful and some parts you could hear more her back up tracks. So no! Katy did it better for me. Hate when these fans ""little faggots' come here and compare both half-time shows, annoying as hell :/﻿"
ham,No boobs no FUN!!!﻿
ham,Awesome touchable at the moment of silence as love to see at dassing symbolize beauty of Katy Perry. God bless Katy Perry.﻿

ham,jajaja el mejor fue el de Vicente Fernández en la plaza México con  más d 90 almas﻿
ham,This Is Katy Perry's trade mark. Don't compare her with other artist like Lady Gaga. They have their own differences. I like Gaga too. So stop comparing them. If you don't like it don't watch it as simple as that.﻿
ham,MISSY IS SO FIRE﻿
ham,"todos los artistas tienen talento, incluso Katy Perry, pero Lady Gaga fue muchísimo mejor, yo creo que el talento esta en cantar 14 minutos de corridos sin parar y sin hacer playback, cantar todas las notas altas, bailar, saltar en el aire y cantar a la vez sin que le tiemble la voz como lo hizo ella sola, y no hacer playback en la mayoría de las canciones, tener tiburones y leones gigantes, y invitar artistas, Gaga lo hizo todo sola, y yo te acepto hay muchas mejores que Gaga, pero el talento que tiene Lady Gaga muy pocos lo tienen hoy, y Katy no es excepción. 
No hay como comparar, el de Lady Gaga si fue un show polemico.﻿"
ham,"Madonna set the bar, made the gig appealing again. But the girls that came after her did wonderful jobs! This is fun!﻿"

ham,I loved Gaga's show more. KP's is a damn good one though.﻿
ham,This is magically beautiful﻿
ham,Superbowl becomes a kids show ... like a Hi-5 show.﻿
ham,"Why Lady gaga is better than this? No special guest (haven't been done for 7 years), 13 minutes cardio performance on a 4 inch heels, High Wire acrobatics, The audience in the field are part of the show, the drones, the message of inclusion, saying hi to her parents, 2 dives, 2 make up change, mic drop and she catched the football, she dance, she played 2 instruments (piano and keytar), and importantanly HER LIVE VOCALS. Afterall, she wasn't overshadowed by other things like left shark. Lady Gaga just put all her talent in super bowl, not just a special effects.﻿"

ham,i kissed a girl is my fave part...cant stop repeating that hight note﻿
ham,Por lo menos gaga no hizo playback﻿
ham,Isn't playback?﻿
ham,did not dance and terrible voice and gaga is too much better﻿
ham,she was good﻿
ham,she didnt consume drugs this time﻿
ham,Not a katy's fan but I can't dent that when she sing roar it's iconic﻿
ham,"Yo oigo musica de Madonna, Gaga, Katy, Beyonce y Britney que han hecho participaciones en este evento, soy fan parcial de todas ellas. Para MI este ha sido él que mas me ha gustado de todos; podrá no bailar, un poco desafinada o lo que quieran decir, pero él punto del medio tiempo a mi opinión es entretener; Katy lo hizo. Y si él show es algo infantil para muchos, hay que tomar en cuenta él tipo de publico que la sigue. Leo muchos comentarios sobre quien lo ha hecho mejor y cada quien sus gustos. Pero YO me quedo con KATY PERRY.﻿"
ham,very very  good﻿
ham,2:18 nice :v﻿
ham,I LOVE YOU KATY﻿
ham,I like some of Gaga's songs and Katy Perry's but for me Katy's halftime show was a visual experience.﻿

ham,The Sharks is a sharks-ira﻿
ham,como se llama la tercera canción?﻿
ham,lo mejor﻿
ham,"No puedo creer que Lenny & Missy que tienen mucho más carrera que Katy, sean  sólo ACOMPAÑAMIENTOS﻿"
ham,lo único que me gusto fueron los tiburones﻿
ham,Lady Gaga slayed her performance but Katy killed it omg 😍😍😍😍😍﻿

ham,케이티도 자기 캐릭터와 이미지에 맞게 잘한것같은데? 일단 라이브도 쩔고 열정도 쩔고.. 레이디가가는 가가의 무대이고 이건 케이티의 무대지 무대의 느낌이 다름..비욘세도 비욘세의 무대고 가장 자기에게 기억에 남는 무대가 있겠지만..여기에 댓글로 가가랑 비교해서 왜케유치해!라고하면 좀 ㅋㅋㅋ﻿
ham,10:05 palyback error﻿
ham,"Don't understand why she became so famous. I don't like her style, her voice (if you can call that a voice) and her image. Probably the best part of the performance was Missy Elliott.﻿"
ham,"Katy has katy's own way to lead the show, and gaga has her way. Pkz lets not compare.﻿"
ham,americans take you seriusly Super Bowl﻿
ham,IT is amazing﻿
ham,Yo sólo vine aquí por los tiburones :v﻿
ham,"The visuals were awesome, but it was used to cover up that horrible sound coming out of her mouth , lip sinc or not she sounds terrible. She should've been a party planner instead.﻿"

ham,My sweet heart slays!﻿

ham,This is amazing I appreciate but gaga was the best gaga loves her fans﻿
ham,"Imo, Gaga's & Katy's halftime performance are both very good but i think Katy's halftime show still is better. Gaga's came second. idk tho i mean Gaga's halftime was nearly excellent but it just seems too organized like why the hell do the crowd below Gaga was all dancing the same and in formation?? it just seems so obvious and it doesn't entertain me, but i still love their performance.﻿"
ham,"Imo, Gaga's & Katy's halftime performance are both very good but i think Katy's halftime show still is the best halftime show for the 2010s.

ham,"after watching Lady Gaga's performance, this looks like a grade school intermission number lol but yes Katy Perry is waaaaaaayyyy hotter and that makes this still worth watching 👍 MJ and Lady Gaga's have the two BEST Superbowl performance ever but Katy Perry's is the CUTEST AND the MOST ADORABLE one 👍﻿"

ham,KATY 💗⭐﻿
ham,best superbowl ever. she did it.﻿
ham,"Me da mucha tristeza que la gente prefiera la tecnología y la producción que el verdadero talento. No importa si la ""artista"" no sabe bailar ni mucho menos cantar, con que tenga una producción impresionante es suficiente. Bien lo dijo un famoso escritor: vivimos en la cultura del envase.﻿"

ham,Her voice is terrible﻿
ham,Is she lip singing?﻿
ham,"Gaga hizo toda la presentación en vivo y la aplaudo por eso, su sonido fue impecable pero creo que no superó (y me duele admitirlo porque soy su fan) porque Katie fue más creativa y supo usar pantallas, luces y efectos... lo que hizo que su show en general fuera más entretenido.﻿"
ham,"when it comes to visuals, this was definitely the best show. vocalwise, i would pick beyoncé.﻿"
ham,lady gaga winer a katy perry ..  super bolw 2015 o 2017?.. =&$€♤\♤|♤umm   2017.. lady gagga.. winer﻿

ham,"Thank You, Katy. This make me shiver everytime i watch this.﻿"
ham,Wooow pretty amazing﻿
ham,toma esto laddy. Gaga﻿
ham,OMG!!!! SO COOL........﻿
ham,The difference between katy and gaga is that gaga can sing live and do it beautifully where as katy can't as her voice is weak thats why she needed her backing track to save her! I do love the show itself like the dancers etc but apart from that lady gagas show was better because she can actually sing and doesn't need all these objects to distract us!﻿
ham,"jesus is coming soon repent, surrender to the saviour before its late﻿"
ham,the production here is probably the best of all superbowls so many chills at the visuals!﻿
ham,The most watched and highest rated super bowl half time show performance of all time. All song she performed is a #1 hit. It's been 2 years but this is still the best.﻿
ham,1. Bruno Mars  and 2. Katy  maybe in that order> yes or no?﻿
ham,I got Goosebumps on Fireworks T_T clap clap clap﻿
ham,"KATY PERRY: STILL THE SUPERBOWL QUEEN, GaGa was really good, I won't deny it, but this whole show is something else, just with that entrance and the f'ing perfect ending. I'll be waiting for someone to beat this one.﻿"
ham,7:23 What song is it?﻿

ham,"no veo lo impresionante de súper bowl, si de vestuarios hablamos, esta parecía esta como en circo con su primer y segundo vestuario y las músicas nada cautivadoras, a mi opinión mucho mejor el de Laddy Gaga y manifiesto no soy fans de ella, pero estuvo súper mejor﻿"
ham,lady Gaga's performance brings me here﻿

ham,She has improved her singing like A LOT﻿

ham,how are they changing so fast.﻿
ham,"Esse sim, pisa em qualquer outro Super Bow. Concordam?﻿"
ham,this is still better!﻿
ham,playback﻿
ham,playback...?﻿
ham,"vocally, that was painful to watch.﻿"
ham,"It's a very bad dancer! 😂 But this is not important, she is a singer! I believe that Lady Gaga did a better job this year, Katy Perry needed 2 other artists to create an immersive performance. However Katy Perry has a great voice! Excuse my English, I'm Italian 😅﻿"
ham,Still the best﻿
ham,The best 😍😍﻿
ham,Gaga was better... Just putting it out there﻿
ham,"great show but the singing is too studio quality which has no echoes or other impurities when compared to the ""make some noise super bowl"" she said at 5:56. Makes me suspect that she lip synced. she's a fantastic performer though.﻿"
ham,Katy > gaga﻿
ham,There is a mouse holding a camera on the left side of the stage 06:23﻿
ham,How is she flying in the Firework portion?﻿
ham,I still die a little when people claim Taylor swift is better than Katy like c'mon just watch this SO MUCH TALENT﻿
ham,Super Bowl 2018 Lady Gaga+ katy perry?﻿
ham,"Wow, this was... absolutely...eh﻿"
ham,Who's watching all the old half time sh we cuz of lady gaga﻿
ham,"The best Super Bowl!!! Katy é rainha, nunca irá ter um Super Bow a altura <3 my mom﻿"
ham,The part with Lenny Kravitz is so hott!!﻿
ham,Super Show Me Encanto Fue El Mejor👌﻿
ham,fue el mejor﻿
ham,MELHOR APRESENTAÇÃO  DO SUPER BOWL 👏💕﻿
ham,I can tell who's I like More Beyoncé Katy or gaga﻿
ham,Wow... that was trash.﻿
ham,Lastima el PlayBack :B﻿
ham,Solamente vine a ver a Missy﻿
ham,Minute 1:04.... She's playbacking. #LOL﻿
ham,"Sinceramente este fue el mejor show en la Super Bowl, Lady Gaga, estuvo bien , pero difícilmente superará este magnífico show en donde, hubo todo lo que se necesitaba para un show de esta magnitud.﻿"
ham,Espectáculo ¿donde esta el talento de la vocalista?﻿
ham,Just for having Missy Elliot in it this is one of the best half-time shows ever.﻿
ham,We see that the price is not a problem for her﻿
ham,on voit que le cout n'est pas un problème pour elle﻿
ham,the scene is very beautiful but i still love lady Gaga's performance more ❤❤❤❤﻿
ham,still liking Katy's performance afterall^^ phenomenal﻿
ham,Taylor could never﻿
ham,I'm here for left shark﻿
ham,"This is for these Katy's stupid fans talking shit about Gaga: the stage killed it for her. The bitch didn't stand 3 minutes alone on the stage without calling for help, because she's boring as hell. She did nothing, no dance, sang actually live about 2 minutes. The stage and the guys that she invited did all the work.﻿"
ham,"for me,  katy Perry is the best﻿"
ham,PROPRIETÁRIA DO SUPER BOWL﻿
ham,kravitz is so fucking hot omg﻿
ham,is this Missy Elliot's Superbowl?﻿
ham,Katy >﻿
ham,Sorry Gaga! even Katy's performance was better than yours﻿
ham,Gaga did it better﻿
ham,i love Lenny Kravitz here﻿
ham,Much better than Gaga.﻿
ham,"Katy Perry Choose not to sing live, put 2 big names for her quests, pull a kids show (literally) and didn't give a shit about her fans... She maybe dressed them as sharks though...

Lady Gaga Performed 100% live doing a full cardio performance, all by herself, she stepped up with high class '80s - '90s show and make her fans part of the super bowl (basicaly almost everyones dream)....

Who is the winner ???? xoxo﻿"
ham,"Lo veo y se me enchina la piel, de nuevo. Lady Gaga no logro eso.﻿"
ham,Out of all the Super bowl performances so far this was the one which made A whole lot of memes that it stayed for years﻿
ham,Totally lip synced😂😂😂😂😂﻿
ham,"I admit this was an excellent job, but Lady Gaga was also amazing as she didn't need all of this special effects, or the participation of other musicians, she shine alone with her powerful voice and dance.﻿"
ham,After I watch Lady Gaga's Superbowl.  My mom Gaga's perf. was better. LOL.﻿
ham,I'm sry but I like this more than Lady Gagas﻿
ham,she made the best﻿
ham,I really like Katy's music but this performance was an embarrassing mess... Just messy.﻿
ham,Qué manía les ha entrado ahora con hacer volar ahora a las cantantes.. Cualquier día tenemos una desgracia﻿
ham,i thought this would be the best <3 until i see Lady Gaga's performance﻿
ham,im here after lady gaga..﻿
ham,gaga has amazing vocals and dancing but overall this is better.. just look at the set designs and costumes.. katy >﻿
ham,Guys Plzzz stop say shitty things like this perform Better than the lady gaga's one Bitch Plzz Shut the fuck up﻿
ham,She's not a good vocalist but a spectacle nonetheless﻿
ham,"2:50 ... EXPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEDDDDTTTTTT!!!!! THE STARTS ""SINGING"" BEFORE HER VOCALS COME IN. EXXXXXPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOSSSSSSSSEEEEDDDTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WATCH CAREFULLY.﻿"
ham,"I'm here after Lady Gaga.and I don't hate Katy,I think she's a talented performer,but this performance wasn't my favourite. I loved the songchoices,I loved the stage and the costumes,but It's so adorable,when after Lady Gaga's performance,people went to her video and comment ""Katy was better two years ago."" Well,I think Gaga was better for me,because I felt the passion,her stagework was amazing and she sang the songs very well. Katy couldn't make it alone,i don't know why she needed Missy and her live vocals weren't the best. I do like both performances,I love both of them,but for me Gaga was more special,because I didn't see her perform like this. That's my oppinion,don't hate me.﻿"
ham,"Katy has decorations (the best ever! look at this tiger at the beginning), costumes and joy but Gaga has dancing and her charisma
Both are great singers! I adore both perfomances so much﻿"
ham,This is amazing. I Love Katy Perry :3﻿
ham,No me decepcionó Gaga👑 pero no superó a Katy Perry👑...﻿

ham,Best Super Bowl Halftimeshow in Super Bowl history!!!!﻿
ham,Aindaa prefiro Gaga e Bey 👑👌﻿
ham,El mas epico.﻿
ham,Qui est la après Lady Gaga ( je sais j'parle français)﻿
ham,Lady Gaga was better﻿
ham,"No me gustó el de Lady Gaga, una mujer reconocida por ser extravagante y por su estilo tan único y divertido y que su medio tiempo en el Super Bowl fuera tan aburrido y vacío, perdón pero el mejor medio tiempo de todos para mi es el de Katy Perry.﻿"
ham,Anyone remember left shark? lmao﻿
ham,"You can say in your opinion this was a better show then Gaga's, but you cannot argue it's a better performance as she's not even singing.﻿"
ham,Guapísima Katy Perry﻿
ham,mucho mejor que el de lady gaga!!!﻿
ham,Muchisimo mejor que lady gaga ❤😍﻿
ham,Is the best!﻿
ham,When do we get Ciara?﻿

ham,That tiger thoe?﻿
ham,1:50 NUNCA DEJARÉ DE AMAR ESA PARTE﻿
ham,better than Gaga﻿
ham,most interesting part in super bowl  is this fuck american football lol﻿
ham,El mejor siempre será este. 💕💖﻿
ham,DAMN THAT KRAVITZ DUET DAMN﻿
ham,a mi me gusto mas el de lady gaga uwu y aún más el de Coldplay con Beyoncé y Bruno Mars﻿
ham,"Boring and ridiculous performance, she needs two guests to hold the show.﻿"
ham,Katy queen the best woman of the world﻿
ham,she is gorgeous !!!﻿
ham,Katy canta muito mal deveria dublar que nem a Britney show horrível﻿
ham,El mejor de todos﻿
ham,EPIC!﻿
ham,This is the greatest Half time ever﻿
ham,Love it! My favorite halftime show!!!﻿
ham,".The most watched Super Bowl Halftime Shows in HISTORY:
1. Katy Perry (118.5 million)
2. Lady Gaga (117.5 million)﻿"
ham,el mejor show del super bowl sin duda❤😍﻿
ham,"Not a fan of Katy, but this is actually one of the best super bowl, And i think gaga's was quite mediocre. I mean, great performace by her, but the show wasn't good enough﻿"
ham,So why was Katy Perry there? They should have just had Missy do the whole thing.﻿
ham,After Gaga and Beyoncé 😉﻿
ham,Lip sync at Super bowl is just an instant fail 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽﻿
ham,I think this is better then lady Gaga﻿
ham,ooooow  😱﻿
ham,desfortunadamente lady💅 gaga no supero 🙊esto aunque fue increible 😫su presentacion. katy perry💃 es inigualable.💕﻿
ham,"1. Lady Gaga
2. Katy Perry
3. Beyoncé 

My favorites 😍﻿"
ham,Here after lady gaga🙋🏼‍♂️﻿
ham,she is so pretty﻿
ham,left shark﻿
ham,aún no superó su presentación 😍❤﻿

ham,lady gaga do it better than katy perry . katy perry and beyonce are copyes.﻿
ham,missy slayed﻿
ham,THE BEST﻿
ham,Song name when she is in the beach with cute sharks?﻿
ham,This is the best Superbowl Halftimeshow everrr..﻿
ham,I love this kids time... lol ♥﻿
ham,"Katy is a beautiful lady and a great performer, but just so you know - she lipsyncs the whole performance (it's pre-recorded probably, as the record is not the regular radio version), and her voice is very weak, especially compared to Beyonce and Gaga. Just saying :)﻿"
ham,comparing all of their performance gaga's the best and MJ 1993﻿
ham,Undoubtedly one of the best shows in the super bowl I do not think anyone can beat the show that hiso Katy Perry really thought that the Lady Gaga me to impact but I did not like but I do not like ... Katy Perry Will remain in history as one of the best half-time shows of the super bowl just amazing﻿
ham,Katy Perry did like nothing and had like little to no dance moves if at all they were minimal. Beyoncé and lady gaga were better﻿
ham,10:09 😩😍❤﻿
ham,"This is better than gaga one,i luv her tho﻿"
ham,Am I here the only one who came to watch the cute sharks?﻿
ham,"6:32    
Katy's face, right after hitting hands with the shar, epic.﻿"
ham,Quién vino después de ver el de Lady Gaga? xDDD﻿
ham,2018 must be Sia's year﻿
ham,"In my opinion Katy did great work but after the superbowls from Katy, Beyonce, Bruno and Coldplay I felt Lady Gaga is a winner. If you are looking at the superbowls last 5 years they are inviting populair singers/bands and lady gaga is the only artist at this years super bowl. That's really brave to do. I'll find every artist a hard worker so I don't want to compare them to each other.﻿"
ham,"for me, this is the best halftime show﻿"
ham,Gaga's & Katy's are my favourite halftime shows!﻿
ham,wow﻿
ham,La diferencia entre el de Katy y el de Gaga esque el de Katy perry fue pre grabado y el de gaga fue completamente en vivo upsss🐍﻿
ham,yo fui﻿
ham,Lenny Kravitz beautiful﻿
ham,para q vienena volver este ami me gusto mas este aq el de lady gaga este año﻿
ham,Quien es la última artista que salio?﻿
ham,me dio vergüenza ajena ver que Katy movía la boca y no cantaba ajjajajajaja 100% lo hizo mejor Gaga ... (y no soy fanática de ella)﻿
ham,Gaga did it better﻿
ham,Moje la cuca!!!﻿
ham,"For some reason I was not expecting Beyoncé in Lady Gaga's show, I was expecting left shark﻿"
ham,Lip Sync.. Lady Gaga is real!﻿
ham,"Still the most watched halftime show of all time. Deal with it little monsters ;)
Reply﻿"
ham,This was incredible! 😱😱😱﻿
ham,el mejor show de medio tiempo del mundo 😍﻿
ham,I don't know why people comparing Gaga and Katy.They are both different.But if we look at both Halftimeshows ; Katy put more work in to it as we see she used her voice so good. In my opinion Gaga has a better style and voice but she just couldnt handle it she sang better in her other performances.I'm fan of Gaga not a hater of Katy her songs are Catchy too but i like Gaga's  music more but honestly Katy did it better this performance is #2 for me in all halftimeshows #1 is ofc MJ﻿
ham,still the best one﻿
ham,"where can i find this ""i kissed a girl "" version ? please help ??????﻿"
ham,it super show﻿
ham,gaga did it better﻿
ham,Gaga is the BEST!﻿
ham,Katy Perry is always better﻿
ham,Better than Gaga IMO﻿
ham,"Sorry katy perry fans, we love u.

But gaga slayed this.﻿"
ham,Me gusto más el de Katy Perry que el de Lady Gaga. Esperaba más de Lady Gaga ya que ella fue reconocida por ser extravagante e icónica pero su presentación en el súper bowl no me gusto tanto.﻿
ham,People can talk shit about this but to me was amazing!!﻿
ham,katy is queen of views and queen to katycat...🙇👸💟﻿
ham,Katy is the best!❤ insuperable!😏﻿
ham,Lad gaga's was amazing... but Missy... com'on she is the queen of rap!!!﻿
ham,Como alguien puede decir que el show de lady gaga fue mejor que este xd? Katy perry fue uno de los mejores medio tiempos del super bowl﻿
ham,Lady Gaga >>> Katy Perry﻿
ham,ı am sorry little monsters this is better than lady gaga's performance. ladys performance is very boring.﻿
ham,So I found out this was most watched after watching Bruno Mars halftime show. I advise everyone who has not seen his halftime show to go see it. I like Katy but based on the fact he had minimal affects and sang his heart out for longer... I just feel his deserves way more credit﻿
ham,Queen👑﻿
ham,This would have been great without the Missy Elliot shite.﻿
ham,pre record﻿
ham,song at 9:18??﻿
ham,i think gagas performance is much better idk... 😄 pls dont hate its just my opinion﻿
ham,alguien sabe castellano﻿
ham,Too Basic :'(﻿
ham,que hace shark-ira ahi﻿
ham,How come this video has 32 million views? Weird how this has millions of views but the actual NFL video form their channel hasn't even broke 1 million. As soon as the show was over the NFL video would have been uploaded and would have been in the trending for a couple days. So how the hell as this video got 32 million views? I say the views have been tampered with and most of those views are fake and their just to make Katy Perry seem she has had the best half time show which btw  it was good but not good enough for 32 million views!﻿
ham,aburrido y muy ñoño. ....mil veces mejor Lady gaga. ..!!!﻿
ham,Como se nota el cambio de Obama a Trump. One of the best half times <BRAVO>﻿
ham,The hallftime of Katy Perry >>>>>> Lady Gaga﻿
ham,That's so cool﻿
ham,Lip-Syncing bitch﻿
ham,Katy es mejor que Lady monstruos﻿
ham,#KatycatsWeAreProudforYouKatyPerry 😍😍😍😍﻿
ham,I am a Lady Gaga Fan. But i need to admit that this show is better than Gagas.﻿
ham,This is my oldest super bowl memory﻿
ham,"THE BEST HALFTIME SHOW EVER!
THE BEEEEEEEESSSSSSSTTTTTTT. KATY IS QUEEN.
FOR EVER, THIS IS THE BEST HALFTIME SHOW EVER!﻿"
ham,and you all tought gaga would top this 💀﻿
ham,The best Super Bowl performance 😻 Queen Katy 👑﻿
ham,Es el mejor super Bowl HalfTime Show de todos lo Shows que se ha realizado... Sin duda alguna Katy Perry Tiene mas visitas que otros Artistas...﻿
ham,"Ok let's be clear. I'm a little monster, but I'm a big fan of Katy too, so don't misundestand me. Katy had more effects, but it doesn't make it better anyway. I watched it again and somehow it makes me lose the interest when Missy Elliot takes the stage. Katy could have sing more hits in that time. Plus, the show was cute and powerful, but a little bit childish, especially the part of Teenage dream. But I have to say that I love the part of Firework, that's magical. 
Going back to Gaga, it's true that she didn't use screens and 3D effects so much like Beyoncé, Katy and Madonna, but that's what makes the performance different and (for me) better. She went political in her elegant and classy way, she made a great entrance by jumping from the roof, she used 300 drones and the show was darker and deeper, and it had amazing lights, colors and fireworks. Why do you need something else? She had her voice, her hits, her choreos and amazing ideas. She didn't need nothing else. And I actually love the idea that she went solo. She proved she worths it, and she needed this to make the world fall in love with her again.

For me, Gaga's the best Halftime Show ever, or at least, the best since Michael Jackson's one, as NFL said.﻿"
ham,Trillion times better than Lady Gaga.﻿
ham,Busqué Super Bowl 2017 y luego terminé viendo el de todos los años 😂😂😂😂﻿
ham,"Bueno lady gaga para no tener artistas invitados lo hizo mejor, fue entretenido , Voz en vivo, baila y canta. katy perry sin sus artistas invitados creo q hubiese sido aburrido ademas  no canto totalmente.﻿"
ham,shes not even singing live tho﻿
ham,"I think Katy was better than Gaga. I think Gaga did the usual thing: a performance of her, with her songs and her usual dancers. Katy bet for something more, with more radical changes and with invited artists, I still prefer Katy, no doubt.﻿"
ham,Katy arraza como sempre.❤﻿
ham,the best﻿
ham,Here realising how amazing gaga really was ....﻿
ham,This halftime show is still the best halftime show EVER﻿
ham,Hopefully britney will perform at 2018 Super Bowl. I know she lip sync but it would be great tribute to her career since performing as a guest in 2001. She could do any of the great hits from late 90s to now﻿
ham,The intro for Dark horse is gold﻿
ham,who is here after watching lady Gaga and Beyonce super bowl﻿
ham,Why does Lenny sound like Ozzy Osbourne here?😂﻿
ham,Ningún HalftimeShow ah Superado a el de KatyPerry﻿
ham,fuck gaga this is 1000 times better﻿
ham,Madonna And michel jacson  amazing﻿
ham,this is sooooo cheap﻿
ham,did she lipsync?﻿
ham,"Gaga was great, BUT THIS IS THE BEST SUPER BOWL IN HISTORY﻿"
ham,"lol this was pretty bad, you could tell whoever was on katy's production team got a ton of money for this gig and spent it all on odd artistic decisions meant to be flashy, in the end it wasn't really that cohesive.﻿"
ham,Lady Gaga is best﻿
ham,gaga live performance vocals r amazing 😍﻿
ham,lady gaga deu uma humilhadinha﻿
ham,am a beehive and core Beyonce's fan but dis has got to be d best Superbowl half time like if u agree﻿
ham,"I think KP played minimalism with no fans on the field (not as audience), not so many dancers around her (if so she always stood out like on DH) and not so many songs or medleys. For me, the key of this show was all the different stages and worlds she created in 13 minutes, and that's what makes this one the most original one and the best for me.﻿"
ham,lady gaga the best 😍﻿
ham,Quien lo he en 2017 😂﻿
ham,better than gaga﻿
ham,"I'm not going to say this but in my opinion this is far the best halftime show ever.
Katy > Beyonce > Gaga.
I dont mean to be rude, but gaga's was nothing different from her concerts. Vocally gaga is better but if we're talking impact, more creativity, more general appeal to the general public katy won this. Plus katy's song choice is better 
Beyonce was good too. Her choreo was everything tho but that's it.﻿"
ham,"the best super bowl of the whole history,slay mom﻿"
ham,i still love this performance most!﻿
ham,still better than 2017 performance﻿
ham,I came here to clear my eyes after Lady Gaga's performance﻿
ham,Las luces están muy bien pero canta horrible la cabrona﻿
ham,"This was way better than this year. Katy had one of the best shows, she entertained EVERYONE, young and old, rock listeners, pop listeners and hip-hop listeners. and the show had many spectacles, from the Lion to the chess board to the flying on shooting star while fireworks explode above you, (dont forget those sharks lol). Theres no way that you didnt like at least segment of this performance. She tried to entertain the maximum amount of people unlike Gaga and Beyonce you arrogantly turned the Super Bowl into their own concert. You dont just have to entertain your fanbase, you have to entertain all the people who DONT like your music too by giving them something to cater to THEIR tastes.﻿"
ham,I think gagas performance was better﻿
ham,Not as good as Gaga's﻿
ham,live ?% gaga 100% live﻿
ham,who's here because the shark is hilarious?﻿
ham,wow. really went without a glitch huh﻿
ham,"Tô em dúvida qual o melhor, pois adoro a gaga também, mais eu acho q o da Kate foi o melhor!﻿"
ham,"still THE BEST halftime show ever! So many hits, so many visuals, fantastic vocals, iconic, Katy is the best!﻿"
ham,"This one won for production value against Lady Gaga's. but Lady Gaga didn't have to bring others to share the stage with her except for her backup dancers. So still having a difficult time deciding which one's best. But, yes, both of them did great :) BEST SHOWS for the whole world to enjoy.﻿"
ham,sorry but no one will top MJ'S﻿
ham,ROARRRRRR﻿
ham,it was the best for a long timeee﻿
ham,Gaga slayed﻿
ham,she has a nice voice﻿
ham,"I love both Gaga and Katy. I think Gaga has a more powerful voice, but i have to admit this show was much better. Especially Firework performance is so amazing and emotional.﻿"
ham,Gaga was ok but Katy still is my fav and did better﻿
ham,WTF!!!!!! lenny kravitz singing katy pary's song ????﻿
ham,Omg﻿
ham,btch da fuck./ Was it prerecorded?﻿
ham,disgasting :D :p﻿
ham,Oh my. those sharks were cute <3﻿

👌🏼﻿"
ham,in the history forever﻿
ham,"I just saw the lady  gaga performance...   This one is better, I mean  wow...  I'm  not a fan boy but from gaga I  expected  more.﻿"
ham,I came here to remember what a real halftime show looks like 💅﻿
ham,who's here after watching gaga's performance?﻿
ham,I'm just here to see the shark dance.﻿

ham,Agora vai a pergunta: existe Super Bowl mais icônico que o da Katy?﻿
ham,"She's so nasal, her mix is too chesty that makes less freedom, her belt is a bit troathy too, her falsetto is a bit off too at some point, and her breath is a bit lost control like often out of breath in phrase. But at least nice show.﻿"
ham,I love Katy Perry!  she is awesome!﻿
ham,"Increíble, simplemente increíble.
Espero que Gaga logre superar esto, oh al menos igualarlo...﻿"
ham,She's the whitest person iv ever seen lol﻿
ham,Mother <3 Queeeeeeeeeeeen﻿

Michael Jackson? Whitney Houston? Just sayin....﻿"
ham,Lady Gaga Could Never﻿
ham,"so epic, so legendary!﻿"
ham,"How can you say this was better than Beyonce's or Madonna's or Bruno's?... The lack of stage presence is real. Katy depends on props... Without all the mega production and setting she would've been the worst halftime headliner (which I think she is). Her ""dance moves"" are shitty and her singing is obviously pre recorded. I know why the dancer stole all her attention lmao...﻿"

ham,ام الشياطين﻿
ham,"Katy set the bar too high for Coldplay for Super Bowl 50; they fell a bit flat even though they had Beyonce and Bruno Mars.
